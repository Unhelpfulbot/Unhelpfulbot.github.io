                    a strong foundation to counteract the recoil from launching. With the final design, parts were machined into CAD dimensions and then assembled.
                    Modifcation on the launcher were required after testing the launcher, espically when it came to the launch angle.

                    During the GOES-R Hackathon, my team of four created a mobile app that converted 2D satellite images to 3D CAD files.
                    This allowed satellite images to be 3D printed, which makes it easier to understand than an infrared image or something.
                    For the converter, there were already software that allowed 2D conversion to 3D so that was what we used since we only had
                    two days to develop an application from scratch. Ultimately, we got first place with our idea to display 2D images in a 3D format.

                      There was four other SYEP workers and we decided to communicate through discord. I decided to create a bot that send annoucment during certain
                     time of the day like when it's lunch break, when break is over, when it's time to leave, and when to start working. 
                     In addition, the bot also has a reaction tracker which was used for determining who was in the building or who went out or stayed in for lunch.

                    Created two 2D Unity games, to begin my journey into programming. Learnt the fundemental of Unity and C# by using YouTube
                    as a resource. First game was multiplayer but ran into a lot of bugs when it comes to the multiplayer aspect. However, the goal
                    was to create a game, where my friends would be able to play. The game worked but causes screen flickering which made it annoying.
                    Therefore, the first game I created was used to teach me the basic of game creation. The second game was a single player RPG game where
                    the player goes around killing monster and then beat bosses.
